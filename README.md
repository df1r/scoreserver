# scoreserver
Node.js app where coaches can log in and register their players' scores on a math league contest

node -i express ejs body-parser
node index.js

This is a server designed for the Central Jersey Math League (CJML) to allow coaches to fill out the score cards during a contest. An administrator enters the contest date and venue, as well as other details, and then chooses when to open and close the name-entry or score-entry permissions for the coaches. After the end of the contest the administrator gets a spreadsheet that can be pasted into a Google Sheet that has been designed to compute the statistics for the whole season.
